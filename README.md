# HCI-Project
Milestone 1: We drew a rough sketch of what we envisioned our app's UI would look like


Milestone 2: We created a basic GUI which successfully connected to the ring, although there was no indicator in the application to demonstrate that the ring's movements were being tracked 


Milestone 3: We added an indicator which could be manually adjusted by other controllers built into the application, but not by the ring itself


Milestone 4: We made the indicator and actuator fully functional in conjunction with the ring. For the actuator, we implemented logic to control a TL135E smart bulb.
